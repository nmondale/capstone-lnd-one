        This plastic bag was found tangled in the branches of a fallen tree near
        the river's edge. The bag appears to be from Target, though the logo is
        partially obscured by mud and wear. Despite environmental initiatives
        and the store's switch to paper bags in recent years, these resilient
        artifacts of consumer culture continue to persist in our waterways.
