export const introductionContent = `Lock and Dam 1 (LD1) takes on a different shape for every individual who interacts with it, much like the river it stands on. For some, LD1 is a brown blob in the corner of the eye of those who pass the Ford Parkway Bridge, for others, it is white letters on a black sign posted into the earth adjacent to the white cliffs of the river valley, for some a history of industry and storied aquatic navigation, others navigate a story of white settler colonialism, the forceful removal of land and culture.  When presented with the opportunity to imagine a place that does better, works better for more people, and moves city infrastructure in a better direction, LD1 stakeholders are put in a unique position, and when pencil is put to a blank piece of paper, the white abyss begs the question, what am I allowed to imagine? How is my understanding of a better river space controlled by the systems of power that define the built environment? How do my lofty aspirations for river space fit into a system that may or may not accommodate them, and do my aspirations even matter, then? LD1 constricts the flow of water down the Mississippi, but established critical studies of how we understand space, both digital and physical (an everything in between), argue that built infrastructure like LD1 also define ideological and material conditions that constrict the flow of knowledge, social and cultural understandings, notions of nature, identity, and the politics of planning. <br> </br> The history of community oriented digital spaces describes how the popular fantasy of a techno-utopia defined the internet as democratizing spaces of shared ideals, equitable governance structures and interpersonal that could facilitate collaboration, information exchange, and a sense of belonging, ignoring the implicit environmental and social exploitation, power imbalances, and commodification of social interactions within the very existence of the internet. The term "User-Agent" is used to describe a dynamically constructed subject position shaped and reshaped by these cultural and built infrastructures that shape the internet and contemporary capitalistic algorithmic interactions. Buildings and urban spaces such as LD1 can be understood as interfaces or platforms that mediate social interactions and shape human behavior, drawing parallels between how the capitalistic web can define the capabilities of a user to how the built city environment can define the capabilities of a resident.  Speculative design practice asks one to consider the true "blankness" of the process of planning, challenging traditional conventions of design that ask for solutions to problems and addressing market needs towards design as a medium for social and ethical exploration, raising questions, and fostering critical infrastructural reflection. Speculative designs may manifest as anything from physical prototypes, fictional artifacts, or multimedia experiences that serve as thought experiments rather than marketable commodities. Mapping both LD1 and the internet as complex matrix of social, material, and infrastructural conditions— interconnected monstrous constructions, speculative design practice, the critical and accessible alternative to current standardized contexts of urban planning, must be understood not only as valuable but necessary considerations in the process of imagining infrastructure.`;

    title: "Mapping Controversies in Architecture",
    author: "Albena Yaneva",
    content: `Literature reflects that there are countless dimensions of understanding physical infrastructure and architecture, however, through the lens of this project, I have chosen to consider city infrastructure through its ability to impact social practices and capacity to influence social interactions, through a process described by Yaneva as "mapping" architecture in Mapping Controversies in Architecture.  Instead of asking "what does this building mean?" Yaneva's mapping architecture allows city User-Agents to ask "what does this building do?". This shift in focus moves us away from reducing architecture to fixed categories, styles, or symbolic meanings, and instead encourages an understanding of architecture as an ongoing process, an intricate network of interactions, and a catalyst for transformation. In this lens, Yaneva argues the "architectural" as a type of mediator, rather than a separate cultural vacuum domain of the material world, regulating the flows of urban actors, distributing people and ideas, and facilitating and impeding communications. Under the assumption that power can belong within a place as well as a person, infrastructure is argued to be a mechanism for exercising power through invisible control or punishment. <br> </br> Through this thinking, one can consider the multi-dimensional infrastructure of Lock and Dam 1 as the physical structure of the dam itself, its materiality, and construction, the network of social and economic activities that depend/depended on the dam, such as river navigation, commerce, recreation, and the social relationships that define the river and the dam, as expressed in the "Dear River" postcards. Beyond this definition, however, mapping architecture asks city User-Agents to add to any definition of infrastructure, according perhaps to their knowledge of how LD1 has existed over time, or their orbital knowledge of research materials such as press coverage, images, interviews with stakeholders, governmental papers, architectural plans, and relevant literature that inform the LD1 space.`

    title: "On Spatial Planning and Marx-ism: Looking Back, Going Forward",
    author: "Ståle Holgersen",
    content: `Ståle Holgerson in <i> On Spatial Planning and Marxism: Looking Back, Going Forward </i>, advocates for a Marxist turn within capitalist conventions of spatial planning. Through a Marxist lens, Holgerson views urban planning as an activity deeply embedded within the capitalist political economy. In the case of LD1, he would argue that contemporary planning or replanning processes and outcomes are shaped by the inherent contradictions and power dynamics of capitalism, especially concerning private property rights and the need for a more collective organization of space. Holgerson describes how Marxist approaches to urban planning emerged in the 1970s, citing theorists Allen J. Scott and Shoukry Roweis as key in challenging the disconnect between a planning theory and planning practice in 1977.  In line with their peers, Scott and Roweis describe the urban planning as a concrete and social phenomenon embedded in capitalism, highlighting how important it is for theorists to unpack the "nature" of urban planning theory as understood conventionally, a tool for everyday policy making, and to understand how it could be a powerful tool in scrutinizing and criticizing existing power relations. To Holgerson, a better system of urban planning theory— one that is more socially just, more environmentally sustainable, makes use of the framework established by Marxist spatial theory, and works with the spatial reasoning established by past Marxist theorists and academics, moving beyond analyzing the "is" of planning, and toward developing strategies for radical social and ecological transformation.`

    title: "From Counterculture to Cyberculture",
    author: "Fred Turner",
    content: `Turner, in <i> From Counterculture to Cyberculture </i>, describes cyberspace as infrastructure far beyond the software of computers and networks, but as a complex culturally constructed space imbued with notions of a digital frontier. Turner deconstructs popular utopian notions of cyberspace in his critical historical analysis of countercultural efforts like New Communalists and the Whole Earth network in the 1960s. The popularity of these counter-cultural movements and their co-optation of technological advancements in driving social change is credited by Turner as foundational to movements of techno-utopianism that emerged in the 1990s and persists today. Turner unpacks how this narrative of digital utopianism can mask the labor and resources required to maintain digital infrastructure, leading to a disconnect between the idealized vision of online spaces and the material and social conditions that support them. In this deconstruction of colloquial digital perspectives, Turner insists on the importance of understanding the social and political context in which technology is developed and used, as cyberculture within cyberspace is deeply intertwined with the ideologies and power structures of society beyond the screen. My intentional choice to host this project on a handmade website is a part of this critical discussion, as through its design and very existence, is a construction of cyberspace and a producer of cyberculture, and in turn participates in the processes Turner describes.`

    title: "Speculative Everything",
    author: "Anthony Dunne & Fiona Raby",
    content: `In the book <i> Speculative Everything </i>, Raby and Dunne define speculative design as a form of design that moves beyond traditional problem-solving-oriented processes towards approaches that operate within the constraints of "reality as it is," describing how speculative design specifically engages with the "unreal" and the fictional as valuable tools for critical reflection and wild social dreaming. Raby and Dunne describe how a sense of future is implicit in design, but stress the importance of considering futures not as a destination, or something to strive for, but as a medium to aid imaginative thought, as all notions of future are alive in the context of today. In this loosening of social reality on the process of imagination comes the value of speculative design as a catalyst for understanding emerging technologies, both in infrastructure and in digital realms, ensuring that technological development is driven by a broader range of voices and perspectives beyond the restrictive frames that infrastructural contexts can force on the processes of imagining. An understanding of the rich history and academic research background behind speculative design practice is vital in understanding the value of the postcards in the "Dear River" collection, a collection that actively participates in this practice, as described by Raby and Dunne.`

    title: "If everything is so smooth, why am I so sad?",
    author: "Anastasia Kubrak",
    content: `Anastasia Kubrak, as editor and interviewer in <i> If everything is so smooth, why am I so sad? </i>, consistently refers to a resident of a contemporary city as a "User" in order to illustrate how individuals are more and more entangled in both physical and digital infrastructures. Actions and in physical city spaces generate data that is captured and processed in cyberspace, which then shape physical lived experiences and choices within the built environment. To Kubrak, data acts as a bridge between the physical and digital, translating actions in the built environment into inputs for digital computational systems. For example, Google's Popular Times feature, which uses smartphone location data to track crowd density, influencing Users' decisions about where to go and potentially rerouting patterns of movement and activity within the physical city. As "Users," individuals are subject to the rules and logics of platforms and algorithms, often without transparency or opportunities for meaningful participation in decision-making processes within a contemporary system of cybernetic urban governance. The pursuit of profit and efficiency with "Smart City" discourse come at the expense of social justice and democratic values, as the interviews within this source call for a more critical and nuanced understanding of the interplay between technology, urban space, and human agency.`

    title: "Manifesto for Cyborgs: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the 1980s",
    author: "Donna Haraway",
    content: `Donna Harway's <i> Manifesto for Cyborgs: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the 1980s </i> argues that contemporarily, boundaries between humans and machines, or nature and culture, have become blurred, making traditional binary categorizations of life obsolete. Haraway understands this blurring as an opportunity to reimagine identity and politics in a way that embraces hybridity, multiplicity, and fluidity. To exemplify this sentiment, Harraway discusses the cyborg, a creature beyond singular identity made of organic "natural" parts, as well as technological. Harraway describes how power hierarchies integral to capitalist technological development are reinforced by "informatics of domination", or systems of control. Using the condensed hybrid image metaphor of the cyborg, Haraway creates a new kind of User-Agent city resident, capable of subverting and challenging dominant ideologies. By embracing the cyborg's rejection of binaries implicit in its existence, one can gain a deeper understanding of how physical and digital infrastructures are shaping the social, political, and spatial dynamics on a complex level. The Manifesto encourages User-Agents to move beyond deterministic narratives, engage with the complexities and contradictions of technology, and actively participate in shaping a future where technology serves humanity and social justice.`
